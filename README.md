# Storj Brews

This is a collection of Homebrew formulas which enable you to more easily install Storj utilities on OSX.

## Installing Homebrew

If you do not already have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running:

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

We recommend running `brew doctor` afterwards and resolving any pertinent issues.

## Tapping

To 'tap' this collection of Homebrew formulas, run:

    $ brew tap storj/storj

## Installing a Formula

Now you can install any formula as you normally would with Homebrew. For example, to install `downstream-farmer`, simply run:

    $ brew install downstream-farmer
